# Motivation
## Challenge
**Neral Machine Translation**

- A family of encoder-decoders and encode a source sentence into a fixed-length vector from which a decoder generates a translation.

**Issue**

- Compressing all the necessary information of a source sentence into a fixed-length vector will lose the effective information.
- The performance of long sentences deteriorates rapidly.

## Solution
Each time the proposed model generates a word in a translation, it (soft-)searches for a set of positions in a source sentence where the most relevant information is concentrated. The model then predicts a target word based on the context vectors associated with these source positions and all the previous generated target words. (Attention Mechanism)

# Model

The new architecture consists of a bidirectional RNN as an encoder and a decoder that emulates searching through a source sentence during decoding a translation.

## Encoder: Bidirectional RNN
A BiRNN consists of forward and backward RNNs. The annotation for each word $x_j$ by concatenating the forward hidden state $h_j(f)$ and the backward one %h_j(b)$, i.e., $h_j = [h_j(f);h_j(b)]$.

Each annotation $h_i$ contains information about the whole input sequence with a strong focus on the parts surrounding the $i^{th}$ word of the input sequence.

## Decoder
Defination of each conditional probability.

where $s_i$ is an RNN hidden state for time $i$, computed by

The context vector $c_i$ is computed as a weighted sum of these annotations $h_i$. $c_i$ is the expected annotation over all the annotations with probabilities $a_{ij}$.

$a_{ij}$ is a probability that the target word $y_i$ is aligned to a source word $x_j$. The weight $a_{ij}$ of each annotation $h_j$ is computed by

where

is an alignment model which scores how well the inputs around position $j$ and the output at position $i$ match. The alignment model directly computes a soft alignment, which allows the gradient of the cost function to be backpropagated through.

### Advantage
- The decoder decides parts of the source sentence to pay attention to.
- Instead of compressing all information in the source sentence into a fixed-length vector, the information can be spread throughout the sequence of annotations which can be selectively retrieved by the decoder accordingly.

# Experiment
## Dataset
- WMT'14 contains the following English-French parallel corpora: Europarl (61M words), news commentary (5.5M), UN(421M) and two crawled corpora of 90M and 272.5M words respectively, totaling 850M words.
- Reduce the size of the combined corpus to have 348M words using the data selection method.
- Use a shortlist of 30,000 most frequent words in each language to train models, and any word not included in the shortlist is mapped to a special token ([UNK]).

## Model
**Two types**

- An RNN Encoder-Decoder
    + 1000 hidden units
- The proposed model RNNsearch
    + forward and backward RNN each has 1000 hidden units
    + Decoder has 1000 hidden units

**Two ways**

- With the sentences of length up to 30 words (RNNencdec-30, RNNsearch-30)
- With the sentences of length up to 50 words (RNNencdec-50, RNNsearch-50)

## Analysis
### Alignment

- Soft-alignment can let the model look at not only one word.
- Soft-alignment can deal with source and target phrases of different lengths, without requiring a counter-intuitive way of mapping some words to or from nowhere ([NULL]).

### Long sentences
The source sentence from the test set

The RNNencdec-50

![Pic](TIM图片20190613012105.png)

It replaced [based on his status as a health care worker at a hospital] in the source sentence with [enfonction de son etat de sante] ('based on his state of health').

The RNNsearch-50

Preserving the whole meaning of the input sentence without omitting any details.

# Future
- To better handle unknown, or rare words.
- Computation is expensive.
